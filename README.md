# PandasWorkshopNeuroscience
A neuroscience applied approach to learning pandas and dataset management.  

For this workshop, download the dataset (not provided) and work through the tutorials, which are written in individual .md files. The final code is also provided, but it is recommended to not look at it unless absolutely necessary. Furthermore, there are many ways to organize your code, and mine is but one humble way.

## Table of Contents (Tutorials)  
1. Introduction
2. Loading in your first dataset
3. Functions (multi-file loading)
4. Pandas data computations
5. Statistics

## Objectives
* **Pandas**. Appreciate what it's good at and what other tools might be better
* A conceptual understanding of functions and object-oriented programming
* Work through some nitty-gritty of datasets.
* How to use documentation and google to program independently and effectively.
