# Statistics  
## Python Vs. Others
### Python
* Best all-in-one package
* Python is probably the best package for **machine learning** and **BIG data**. 
* Pandas and statsmodels is an acceptable substitute for R most of the time.
* Python is relatively simple to use, although Matlab is the easiest.
* GUIs aren't as easy to build as in matlab, but they work anywhere.

### R
* by far has the most **comprehensive statistics**. If you want a complicated statistical test hardly anyone has heard of, I almost guarantee R will have it.
* Very good at *exploration*. If you're good at R, you can make a lot of graphs really fast.
* Limited usability for anything other than stats.

### Matlab
* Expensive
* Great at data manipulation
* Almost as good as python for multi-purpose science programming, but with serious caveats (advanced GUI support almost non-existent. If you want to dig in and modify a function it's almost impossible.)
* Professional Support. If you can't figure out how to use a function, they have professional staff on hand.

## Statsmodels  
With that fun comparison of languages, let's begin our exploration of *statsmodels*, python's "R substitute". Let's look at the documentation:  
https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/user-guide.html  
Here we are presented with the user guide. The home page has some extended examples of usage.  

Here is the task:
* find a function to implement the welsh t-test, a common task in scientific analysis.

Hints:  
! the welsh t-test is a variation on the standard two-tailed t-test, but accounts for unequal variances.
