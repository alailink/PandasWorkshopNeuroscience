# PandasWorkshopNeuroscience
An applied approach to learning pandas and dataset management.  

For this workshop, download the dataset (not provided) and work through the tutorials, which are written in individual .md files. The final code is also provided, but it is recommended to not look at it unless absolutely necessary. Furthermore, there are many ways to organize your code, and this is certainly not absolutely optimized.
